Description:

This is a personal finance tracker currently in development to help track personal finances and budgeting for myself (ShadowForge17) as well as a virtual accounting software to keep detailed logs and receipts/ statements for storing the information. 

At present the Project is in it's initial Design Phase and no code has been generated to review/deploy although I will be working on this on and off in my free time as I wish to expand my knowledge and skills producing a useful application that could help some people dissatisfied with the present market tools for such programs that cost a premium for subscriptions. The current design documents can be found under the ADMIN folder, currently the document included lines out the core features and other added features I wish to include and implement through the process. As the project is in it's initial phase it is a very rudementary roadmap at present and will be expanded upon as I delve further into development. 

I am open to suggestions and optimizations that will improve the application and my understanding of creating programs. I have chosen to make this project Open Source and the repository Public because this project is a side project for me and if anyone wishes to use it I believe they should be able to and alongside that be able to customize to their own liking.
